  I Needed A Good Place For You To See My Homework Tom, So I'll Put It Here<br/>
  The Mayans were a Mesoamerican (See https://tinyurl.com/y8ynm8hc)<br/>
civilization, developed by the Maya<br/>
peoples, and noted for its 'pictorial text', witch isthe only known<br/>
fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas, and<br/>
many different subjects, like maths and art.<br/>
<br/>
One of there most famous structures is called El Castillo, at<br/>
Chichen Itza. The structure is similar to a piramid in shape, but has<br/>
stairs on the sides going up into a chamber sort of area at the<br/>
top. Inside, their is a long staircase going down leading to a<br/>
room with multiple statues. That was all I could find about the<br/>
enterior of El Castillo.<br/>
<br/>
Their is a large 'arena' made out of stone with a ball made ot ouf<br/>
rubber (I think) and lasted for two weeks. Another thing I found out<br/>
is that they MAYA of (sorry for the rubbish, punworthy jokes)had<br/>
animal skulls around the court.
